# Music-Genre-Recommendations-
ML project
In a music genre classification project, the objective is to predict the genres of unlabeled tracks using a dataset containing various musical features. The dataset is extensive but lacks specific genre information for a significant portion of the records. The approach involves employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. By transforming correlated features into principal components, the data becomes more manageable, and hidden patterns are revealed. The derived principal components will be used in conjunction with logistic regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm, to predict the genres of the unlabeled tracks. The rationale behind using PCA is to address the complexity of music tracks, where numerous features may be correlated, and reducing dimensionality can improve classification algorithm performance by eliminating noise. The project emphasizes the intuitive and accessible nature of the dataset's features, allowing a focus on core concepts of PCA and machine learning without requiring specialized audio knowledge.

The project involves the following steps:
1. Data Exploration
2. Correlation Analysis
3. PCA for Dimensionality Reduction
4. Evaluating Classification Efficacy â€“ PCA-Transformed vs. Original Data
5. Genre Prediction and Integration

The use of PCA in this project is aimed at addressing the complexity of music tracks, where numerous features may be correlated, and reducing dimensionality can improve classification algorithm performance by eliminating noise. This approach allows for a focus on core concepts of PCA and machine learning without requiring specialized audio knowledge.

Additionally, other research works have also utilized PCA for music genre classification, where it was used to extract significant components from feature sets before running clustering algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of PCA in this context.

The use of PCA in music genre classification projects is well-established and has shown promising results in improving the performance of machine learning algorithms for genre prediction.
